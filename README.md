# Manga2Djvu

A handy-dandy python script to convert chapters downloaded from mangalib.me to a single DJVU book

***LINUX ONLY***

could be ported to windows, but, bruh, i am not doing that

### Installation

1. Download the script.py and place it anywhere you want
2. Install `python3`, `djvulibre-bin` packages
3. ???
4. Profit!

### Usage

On the top of the script you need to specify:
- `indir` path (thats a path to the directory in which all downloaded chapters are stored and ***nothing else should be there***),
- `outdir` path (a path where all temporary files will be output, ideally it should be empty, but thats not necessary)
- `outfname` (a name of a final DJVU file)
- ***optionally*** you can set a `DPI` parameter which contols, you guessed it, the DPI of the page

After all parameters are specified, launch a python script with `python3 script.py`.(duh)

Then you should sit and wait untill you see "done!" printed

The final book will be in the `outdir` path somwhere between countless "volN" folders
